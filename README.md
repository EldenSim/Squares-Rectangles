# Squares-Rectangles
This code was created for fun by 16 yr old me to dabble in the basics of numpy and arrays in python
## Main.py
This file runs code that allows the user to set their desired grid size and choose the number of squares and rectangles they want
## Reading data.py
This file basically determines if there is a square or rectangle in the arrays created in Main.py
